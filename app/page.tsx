                  Among the events held at the Commons Hub, the Crypto Commons Gathering has always held a special place. What began in 2021 as a modest excuse for then-PhD researcher Felix Fritsch to bring together crypto-commons thinkerers from around the world in his own backyard has since evolved into an annual moment of (re)connection and reflection for a growing community, and for the many lived practices and experiments in commoning, degrowth, mutualism and post-capitalist economic worldbuilding it is linked to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, CCG has welcomed activists, researchers, hackers, builders, artists, game designers and others, newcomers and "OGs" alike. It has shaped itself as a convivial and fertile space for people and projects working across and beyond web3 to cross-pollinate visions, trajectories and strategies for realising regenerative and cooperative infrastructures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While remaining an unconference at heart, each edition has reflected the community's shifting priorities and aspirations. In 2025, the gathering enters its fifth year, presenting not only a space to collectively take stock of what crypto commons has become and what it still could be, but also a moment for the growing community to think and organize itself anew.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This year's edition marks a shift in infrastructure as well:

                    The Commons Hub has become a full-fledged event hosting organization of its own, co-led by brothers Felix and Emil Fritsch, with exciting expansion and ecovillage plans in the works.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Crypto Commons Association, until 2024 stewarded by Felix Fritsch and Giulio Quarta, is being reimagined as a cooperative vehicle for organising and supporting events at the Hub and elsewhere, introducing and evolving peer-production values and frameworks around them.

            <p>
              An unconference is a participant-driven event format that emphasizes open, flexible, and spontaneous
              discussions rather than traditional pre-planned presentations. Unlike conventional conferences,
              unconferences have no predefined agenda or speakers. Instead, attendees collaboratively propose topics,
              sessions, and activities on the spot, usually at the beginning of the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants vote or self-organize around topics they find most interesting, forming small groups or
              breakout sessions where discussions, workshops, or hands-on activities take place. The structure
              encourages active participation, collective knowledge sharing, and informal networking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unconferences are particularly valuable for fostering creativity, innovation, and community engagement,
              as everyone is considered equally qualified to contribute, share insights, and guide conversations.
              Common formats include open space technology, barcamps, and lightning talks, all of which rely heavily
              on attendee interaction and collective decision-making.
